Sure! Here's a documentation guide for collaborators to understand the collaboration workflow in the project, including branching, issue handling, and best practices:

## Collaboration Workflow Guide for Collaborators

### Branching Structure

The project follows a branching structure with two main branches: `main` and `dev`. The `main` branch represents the production-ready code, and the `dev` branch serves as the primary branch for ongoing development. Collaborators should follow the steps below when working on new features, bug fixes, or enhancements:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:416rehman/contractrPro.git
   ```

2. **Create a Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch based on the `dev` branch. Use the following naming conventions for branch names:
    - **feat**: Indicates the addition or implementation of a new feature. Example: `feat/user-authentication` - Branch for implementing user authentication feature.
    - **bug**: Indicates a branch dedicated to fixing bugs or addressing issues. Example: `bug/login-crash` - Branch for fixing a bug that causes a crash during login.
    - **docs**: Used for documentation-related tasks, such as updating or creating new documentation. Example: `docs/update-readme` - Branch for updating the README documentation.
    - **refactor**: Used for code refactoring or improving existing code without adding new features or fixing bugs. Example: `refactor/api-endpoints` - Branch for refactoring API endpoints to improve code structure. 
    - **ci**: Used for changes related to continuous integration (CI) configuration or build processes. Example: `ci/add-test-coverage` - Branch for adding test coverage to the CI pipeline.
   ```
   git checkout -b <branch_name> dev
   ```

3. **Work on the Issue**: Assign yourself to an open issue from the project's issue tracker. Review the issue description, requirements, and any related discussions. Make the necessary changes to address the issue.

4. **Commit and Push Changes**: Once you've made the required changes, commit your work using descriptive commit messages. It's recommended to break down your work into small, logical commits. Use the following commands to commit and push your changes:

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the project's repository on GitHub and navigate to the "Pull requests" tab. Click on "New pull request" and select your branch (`<branch_name>`) as the source branch, and `dev` as the target branch. Provide a clear title and description for the pull request, referencing the associated issue(s).

6. **Review and Address Feedback**: The project maintainers and other collaborators will review your pull request. Address any feedback or suggestions provided during the review process by making additional commits to your branch.

7. **Merge into `dev`**: Once your pull request has been approved and all feedback has been addressed, it will be merged into the `dev` branch.

### Best Practices and Tips

Here are some best practices and tips to keep in mind while collaborating on the project:

- **Pull Frequently**: Before starting any work or pushing changes, make sure to pull the latest changes from the `dev` branch to your local branch. Use the following command:

  ```
  git pull origin dev
  ```

- **Clear and Descriptive Commits**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that summarize the changes made. This helps other collaborators understand the purpose of each commit.

- **Follow Coding Standards**: Adhere to the project's coding standards and style guidelines. Maintain consistent formatting and naming conventions throughout your code.

- **Test Locally**: Before creating a pull request, test your changes locally to ensure they work as intended and don't introduce new issues.

- **Use Meaningful Branch Names**: Choose branch names that accurately describe the issue or feature you're working on. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each branch.

- **Communicate and Collaborate**: If you have questions or need clarification on an issue or task, don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers or other collaborators. Effective communication and collaboration are key to successful project development.

### Conclusion

By following this collaboration workflow and best practices, you can effectively contribute to the project's development. Remember to create branches for each task, commit frequently with descriptive messages, and create pull requests for review and merging into the `dev` branch. Your contributions will help in
